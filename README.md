# Atom Unicorn theme

Unicorn UI theme for Atom that matches the [unicorn syntax](https://atom.io/packages/unicorn-syntax)

Currently, atom's package upload is failing for this package (no idea why). So if you'd like to install:

```
cd ~/.atom/packages
git clone https://github.com/unicorn/atom-unicorn-syntax
```

This theme can then be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
